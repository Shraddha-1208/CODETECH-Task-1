Key Activities:
- Data Preprocessing:Cleaning and organizing the dataset to handle missing values and prepare it for analysis.Additionally, scaling the data using MinMaxScaler to normalize features for consistent analysis.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):Visualizing price trends over time (e.g., using line charts), and summarizing key statistics such as average prices, daily price changes, and volume fluctuations.
- Time-Series Analysis:Identifying seasonal patterns, trends, and potential anomalies in Bitcoin prices using statistical methods or machine learning models.
